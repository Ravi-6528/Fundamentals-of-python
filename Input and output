#This is the very first program in the programming language., this file contains the declaration of print function.
print is used to display the message as well as the value on the standard output device (monitor),
use of print function is very easy,
you have to just pass the string (message) that you want to print on the screen within inverted commas ("message").

#code

print("Hello world")

#There are few escape sequences which is used for formatting the output in the python  programming language,
you have to use \t escape sequence in order to provide 4 to 5 spaces between words in the output console.
Enter the escape sequence directly into the print statement's within the inverted commas ("mes\tsage").

#code

print("Hello World \t Hello World")

#There are few escape sequences which is used for formatting the output in programming language,
you have to use \n escape sequence in order to provide a new line between words in the output console.
Enter the escape sequence directly into the print statement's within the inverted commas ("mes\nsage").

#code

print("Hello World\nHello World")

#Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks.
Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are print and input().
Write a program to get an integer as input and print it. The input() function reads formatted input from the keyboard.
When the user enters an integer, it is stored in variable test Integer. NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.

#code

a=int(input())
print(a)

#Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks.
Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are print and input().
Write a program to get float as input and print it. The input() function reads formatted input from the keyboard.
When the user enters a float, it is stored in variable test Float.
Use '%.2f' in the print() to display float value with 2 precisions.
NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.

#code

a=float(input())
print("%.2f"%a)

#Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks.
Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are print and input()..
Write a program to get a character as input and print it. The input() function reads formatted input from the keyboard.
When the user enters a character, it is stored in variable test Character.
NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.

#code

x=input()
print(x)

#Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are print() and input().
Write a program to get the string as input and print it. The input() function reads formatted input from the keyboard.

#code

x=str(input())
print(x)

#ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Write a program to get a character as input and print it's ASCII value.
When a character is entered, the character itself  stored.  And when we displayed that value using "int()"  type casting ,
the entered character is displayed as Ascii value.
NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.

#code

x=input()
print(ord(x))

#ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Write a program to get a number(ASCII) as input and print its equivalent character.
You can display a character if you know ASCII code of that character.

#code

a=int(input())
print(chr(a))
