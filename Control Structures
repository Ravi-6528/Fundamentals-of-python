#The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month.
They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant.
If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
Note: The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.
[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest to output]

#code

print("Enter the number of months:")
if a==1:
    print("The amoeba size is 0")
elif a==2:
